# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization Projectt

This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing COVID-19 time-series data sourced from the CSSEGISandData GitHub repository. The objective is to explore the trends in confirmed COVID-19 cases across different countries/regions over time.

## Project Overview

### Data Source(s)

The dataset is sourced from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) repository:

- **Dataset**: [time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv)

### Key Steps in the Project

1. Load the data and handle missing values.
2. Reshape the data for time-series analysis.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize and understand the data.
4. Visualize trends in COVID-19 cases using line plots.
5. Save the cleaned dataset for further use.

## Code Overview

### Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used in the project:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **seaborn**: For creating data visualizations.
- **matplotlib**: For plotting charts.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.

### Steps in the Script

1. **Data Loading**:
   - The dataset is loaded directly from the JHU CSSE GitHub repository using `pandas.read_csv()`.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Missing values are handled using `dropna()`.
   - The dataset is reshaped using `pd.melt()` to transform the wide format into a long format for time-series analysis.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Summary statistics (`data.describe()`) and dataset metadata (`data.info()`) are printed for better understanding.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - A line plot is created using `seaborn.lineplot()` to visualize the trend of confirmed COVID-19 cases over time for various countries/regions.

5. **Save Cleaned Data**:
   - The cleaned dataset is saved locally as `covid19_cleaned_data.csv`.

## Usage Instructions

### Setup Environment

Ensure the following libraries are installed in your Python environment:

```sh
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
